# CTA-BootCamp-Project-1-37466

This EDA project aims to perform data cleaning, preprocessing, exploration, and visualization of a dataset using Python with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. 

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The raw dataset in CSV format is loaded into the Python environment using Pandas.
Next, the dataset is examined for missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
I checked for missing data and duplicate columns and there were none. 
Another task I did was to identify categorical variables and encode using one-hot encoding for modeling purposes.

### Data Exploration 

Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics are calculated to summarize the dataset, including mean, median, and standard deviation.

Distribution of Key Variables: The distribution of key variables, such as customer demographics (age, gender), usage patterns (monthly charges, total charges), and churn status, is explored.

Correlations Between Variables: Correlations between variables are calculated and visualized using a heatmap.

Hypothesis Tests: T-tests are conducted to compare differences between churned and non-churned customers.

Summary Tables: Summary tables and statistics are created for various customer segments, such as by contract type or payment method.

### Data Visualization 

 A variety of visualizations are generated to communicate findings, including bar plots, histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and pie charts.

## Summary of the Project
There is more correlation between the number of churned customers and the gender female. Male customers are more in the category of churned customers. In addition, there is more percentage of churned customers than the non-churned ones
